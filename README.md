# University-Projects
Python code written for use in my studies, usually to analyse data and plot graphs.

## UV-Vis
For use when extracting data from UV-Vis spectroscopy. Data was from SpectraSuite software. The experiment was on investigating the emission spectra resulting from electronic screens, where three distinct peaks (corresponding to red, green, and blue light) would appear. Gaussians are fitted to these three peaks and peak intensities are extracted.

## Surface Brightness Profiles
GAIA software was used for an astronomy project, where surface photometry was done on images of galaxies using elliptical apertures. The code was written to plot the files and fit them to the Sersic function to extract the Sersic index (degree of curvature of the function). Multiple variations of the code allow for either plotting of multiple files or to plot different fits across a specific range.
