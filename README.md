# University-Projects
Python code written for use in my studies, usually to analyse data and plot graphs.

## UV-Vis
For use when extracting data from UV-Vis spectroscopy. Data was from SpectraSuite software as a .txt file. The experiment was on investigating the emission spectra resulting from a computer screen, where three distinct peaks (corresponding to red, green, and blue light) would appear. Gaussians are fitted to these three peaks.
